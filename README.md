## About Me 
I am an Academic and Curricular Analyst pursuing a Master of Science in Data Analytics from Western Governors Univerity. 
## Project 1: Student Success Initiative
For this project, I researched 350 students and determined which students were on track to graduate within 4 years by veiwing academic reports and creating datasets for each freshman cohort. Once I identified our target students, I conducted an outreach stragety that involved email communication. Over the course of 2 years, the 4-year graduation rate increased by 135%.
