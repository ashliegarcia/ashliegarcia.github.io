## About Me 
I am an Academic and Curricular Analyst pursuing a Master of Science in Data Analytics from Western Governors Univerity. 
## [Project 1: Student Success Initiative](https://github.com/ashliegarcia/student_success_project)
For this project, I researched 350 students and determined which students could graduate within 4 years by reviewing academic reports and creating datasets for each freshman cohort. Once I identified our target students, I conducted an outreach strategy that incentivized students to stay on track. Over 2 years, the 4-year graduation rate for the School increased by 135%.
