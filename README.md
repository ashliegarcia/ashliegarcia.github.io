+ Data Analysis Portfolio
## About Me 
I am an Academic and Curricular Analyst pursuing a Master of Science in Data Analytics from Western Governors Univerity. 
## [Project 1: Student Success Initiative](https://github.com/ashliegarcia/student_success_project)
For this project, I researched 350 students and determined which students could graduate within 4 years by reviewing academic reports and creating datasets for each freshman cohort. Once I identified our target students, I conducted an outreach strategy that incentivized students to stay on track. Over 2 years, the 4-year graduation rate for the School increased by 135%.
## [Project 2: How's Our LinkedIn Doing? (Exploratory Data Analysis)](https://github.com/ashliegarcia/linkedin_analysis)
I'm currently working on this project that has a hypotheical scenario and explores data based on LinkedIn visitors and followers. The following is a snippet of the project. 
+ I visualized both Total Page Views for both desktop and mobile visitors. Desktop had the highest views on October 13, 2022 with 51 views. Mobile had the highest views on August 17, 2022 with 111 views. 
+ Plans for future analysis:
  + Compare average number of visits per week, month, and overall.
  + Compare total number of visitors and followers by location, job function, seniority, industry, and company size. 
  + Combine insights to find any similarities within the categories.
